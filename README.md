## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 🟢 Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- 📦 npm

### Installation

1. **Navigate to backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd EzStudyBackend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`

## 🔧 Configuration

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Your Groq API key for AI chat completions | ✅ |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 3001) | ❌ |

### Getting a Groq API Key

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to your `.env` file
